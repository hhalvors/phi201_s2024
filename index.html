<p>Logic is the oldest and most foundational of the university
disciplines — having been taught every year for nearly 1000 years. The
goal is to equip you with most general possible framework for sound and
rigorous reasoning — one that will support you in any intellectual
activity you pursue (e.g. mathematics, politics, chemistry, English
literature, law, religion, etc.). What’s more, logic aspires to be
independent of the quirks of a particular natural language, programming
language, or mathematical system. In this sense, logic aims to to
capture that which is universally rational. (We might argue later about
the extent to which logic is universal, but we will have to use logic to
do that!)</p>

<h1 id="academic-integrity">Academic integrity</h1>
<p>The policy for this course is that collaboration between students is
encouraged, but in no case should one student copy another’s work. That
is hardly a precise criterion, but the spirit of the law is that you
need to <em>understand</em> what you write down on your paper. If you
fail to do that, then your lack of understanding will most likely reveal
itself on the exam. As a general rule, we would suggest that you put
away any notes from joint brainstorming sessions before writing your
final answers.</p>
<p>It would be pointless for us to try to prevent you from using ChatGPT
and the like. But please note: we have tested ChatGPT on the problem
sets for this class, and it is <em>not</em> generally reliable in giving
correct solutions to the kinds of problems we pose. It gave us, e.g., a
“proof” of Pierce’s law that did not use the DN rule (which is provably
impossible).</p>

<h1 id="subject-matter">Subject matter</h1>
<p>While this subject has been taught for many hundreds of years, the
content got an overhaul in the mid 1900s, when modern symbolic logic was
consolidated. (The content has been mostly stable now since the 1950s.)
Since then, the standard format for an introductory logic class has been
to learn the “predicate calculus” in three steps: propositional logic,
monadic predicate logic, polyadic predicate logic. We follow this same
outline, but with a few twists.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>We emphasize reasoning techniques (natural deduction) over
calculational techniques (truth tables or trees).</p></li>
<li><p>We teach proofs before truth tables. It’s harder, but makes your
brain stronger.</p></li>
<li><p>We incorporate more analysis of arguments in natural language
(e.g. argument mapping).</p></li>
<li><p>We illustrate logical concepts, when helpful, by displaying them
concretely in the general framework of functional programming languages.
However, this course presupposes no background in programming, nor does
it presuppose that students are interested in programming.</p></li>

<h1 id="schedule">Schedule <a name="schedule"></a></h1>
<h2 id="week-1">Week 1</h2>
<p><a href="pset1.html">pset1</a> is due on the first Friday of classes.
It covers basic concepts, some translation, and some simple proofs.</p>
<p>Reading: Chapters 1 and 2</p>
<h2 id="week-2">Week 2</h2>
<p><a href="pset2.html">pset2</a> covers more translation and proofs
with dependency numbers (conditional proof and <span
class="math inline">∨</span> elimination)</p>
<p>Reading: Chapter 3</p>
<h2 id="week-3">Week 3</h2>
<p><a href="pset3.html">pset3</a> covers more proofs (<span
class="math inline">∨</span> elimination and RAA)</p>
<p>Reading: Chapter 3</p>
<h2 id="week-4">Week 4</h2>
<p><a href="pset4.html">pset4</a> covers truth-table problems</p>
<p>Reading: Chapter 5</p>
<h2 id="week-5">Week 5</h2>
<p><a href="pset5.html">pset5</a> asks you to synthesize the topics we
have covered so far, and it covers meta-rules (substitution, cut, and
replacement)</p>
<p>Reading: Chapter 4</p>
<h2 id="week-6">Week 6</h2>
<p>Midterm exam</p>
<p>The exam is administered in-class, and you have 80 minutes to
complete it. You are <em>not</em> permitted to use any computational
devices, especially not any that are connected to the internet. You may
bring a a two page “cheat sheet” for quick reference during the exam. On
this sheet you can include things like the inference rules, some key
definitions, and perhaps a couple of the more tricky proofs that you
have already written.</p>
<h2 id="week-7">Week 7</h2>
<p><a href="pset7.html">pset7</a> covers translation into predicate
logic, and proofs with UE and EI</p>
<p>Reading: Chapter 6 (pp 84-94)</p>
<h2 id="week-8">Week 8</h2>
<p><a href="pset8.html">pset8</a> covers more translation, and proofs
with UI. (There is a challenging conceptual move that we make at this
stage: the use of arbitrary names.)</p>
<p>Reading: Chapter 6 (pp 94–115)</p>
<h2 id="week-9">Week 9</h2>
<p><a href="pset9.html">pset9</a> coverts more translation, and proofs
with EE.</p>
<p>Reading: Chapter 6 (pp 94–115)</p>
<h2 id="week-10">Week 10</h2>
<p><a href="pset10.html">pset10</a> covers theories about equality,
ordering, and functional relations</p>
<p>The equality relation greatly increases our expressive power. In
particular, we are now able to formulate (finite) numerical claims. We
can also formulate “definition descriptions”, such as the infamous “The
present king of France is bald”.</p>
<p>Reading: Chapter 7 (pp 116-131)</p>
<h2 id="week-11">Week 11</h2>
<p>In <a href="pset11.html">pset11</a>, you will represent “structures”
in which propositional logic sentences can be true or false. Using these
structures, you can determine whether sentences are tautologies,
contingencies, or inconsistencies. You can also determine whether
arguments are valid or invalid.</p>
<p>Reading: Chapter 8</p>
