<p>Logic is among the oldest and most foundational of the university
disciplines. The goal is to equip students with most general possible
framework for sound and rigorous reasoning — one that works regardless
of topic area (e.g. politics, or chemistry, or English literature, or
…), and regardless of the specific quirks of your natural language or
programming language or mathematical system.</p>

<h1 id="outline-of-topics">Outline of topics</h1>
<p>Ever since modern symbolic logic was consolidated (in the mid 1900s),
the standard format for an introductory logic class has been to learn
the classical predicate calculus in three steps: propositional logic,
monadic predicate logic, polyadic predicate logic. We follow this same
outline, but with three twists.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>We emphasize reasoning techniques (natural deduction) over
calculational techniques (truth tables or trees).</p></li>
<li><p>We incorporate more analysis of arguments in natural language
(e.g. argument mapping).</p></li>
<li><p>We illustrate the logical concepts, when helpful, by displaying
them concretely in the general framework of functional programming
languages. However, this course presupposes no background in
programming, nor does it presuppose that students are interested in
programming.</p></li>
